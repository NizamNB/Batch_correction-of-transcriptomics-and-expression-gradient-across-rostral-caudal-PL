# Batch_correction-of-transcriptomics-and-expression-gradient-across-rostral-caudal-PL
In this project, I aim to correct batch effects across spatial transcriptomics datasets generated using different technologies. Following batch correction, I investigate sex-specific differences in mice within the PL region, with a focus on expression gradients along the rostral–caudal axis.
